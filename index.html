      <h2>Not what they seem</h2>
      <p>The once noble pigeon has been warped and transformed into a sickly,
        disease-ridden bird that huddles in gray masses, scavenging our city
        streets for discarded chicken bones and soggy french fries. They rummage
        through pungent city trash cans scratching the last bits of spoiled food
        from discarded takeout containers. They are ubiquitous in US cities. But
        harmless? Think again.</p>

      <p>Consider this: <em>have you ever seen a baby pigeon?</em> Isn't that
        enough to convince you that something nefarious is going on?</p>

      <h2>Deep state operatives</h2>
      <p>Pigeons are working as biotech spies for the government. Loaded with
        surveillance technology, the pigeons spy on the public, collecting your
        private data and transmitting it directly to the DSIA &ndash; the secret
        Deep State Intelligence Agency inside the CIA.</p>

      <p>Our army of patriot hackers intercepted CIA emails. The level of deceit
        by our government is without precedent. </p>

      <p>They want you to think these birds are trash. They want you to ignore
        them. And you do &ndash; but at what price? Your freedom!</p>

      <h3>Terms you should know</h3>
      <p>These seem like harmless phrases, but be aware when the fake news uses
        them:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Conservation</dt>
        <dd>A government plot to enable more bird drones to infiltrate our
          country</dd>
        <dt>NASA</dt>
        <dd>National Association to Steal All personal information</dd>
        <dt>Antarctica</dt>
        <dd>A government wall around the [flat] earth to keep drones from flying
          away</dd>
